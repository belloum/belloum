About me
======

Hi, I’m Rafik. I’ve been working as a *maître de conférences* (~associate professor) in Computer Science at Université Polytechnique Hauts-de-France since the 2022–2023 academic year, where I’m also a member of the [LAMIH laboratory (UMR CNRS 8201)](https://www.uphf.fr/lamih). Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [DIVA group](https://diva.telecom-paristech.fr/) at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), where I explored interaction design for explainable AI. I previously completed a PhD in 2020 in the [PHOENIX team](http://phoenix.inria.fr/) at [Inria Bordeaux](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-bordeaux), focusing on user-driven development methods for ambient assisted living technologies.

My research lies in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a focus on supporting the design and use of intelligent systems that are better aligned with human needs. I work on providing methods, tools, and interfaces for both system designers and end users.

I follow a user-centered approach that combines need analysis, iterative design, and evaluation, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. I apply this work in areas such as smart home technologies for older adults and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).

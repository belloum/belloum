### Research Interests

I study how interactive systems can be better designed to support people in their everyday lives — especially when these systems involve complex or intelligent behaviors.

I contribute with methodologies, tools, and interfaces that help users appropriate and make sense of these technologies, and support designers and developers in building intelligent systems that better fit users’ needs and context.

To do so, I use methods that combine elements from human-computer interaction and software engineering — including iterative design, user studies (both qualitative and quantitative), systematic reviews, etc.

I’ve applied this approach in areas such as ambient assisted living, including smart home services for aging in place, and explainable AI, where I explore how interface design can help users interpret algorithmic decisions.

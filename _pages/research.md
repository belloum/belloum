### Research Interests

I explore how to build interactive systems that fit people's needs and contexts, especially when these systems involve complex or intelligent behaviors.

I contribute methodologies, tools, and interfaces based on a human-centered approach that help users appropriate and make sense of such technologies, while supporting designers and developers in creating systems that are better adapted to real-world use.

To do so, I draw on methods from both human-computer interaction and software engineering: iterative design, user studies (qualitative and quantitative), systematic reviews, etc.

I’ve applied this approach in areas such as ambient assisted living, with smart home services for aging in place; and explainable AI, where I examine how interface design can help users interpret algorithmic decisions.
